Growing up, I didn't have any visible queer role models. There was no one around me who was openly queer, which made me feel very alone. I kept these memories from high school - notes from friends, pictures from school events where I always felt like an outsider. Now I can look back and understand that those feelings were valid. I wish someone had told young me that there was a whole community out there waiting to embrace me. These photos are my way of honoring that journey.
